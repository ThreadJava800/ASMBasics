# Assembler basics

Here i will put my basic assembler programs.

For now I have created a [library](https://github.com/ThreadJava800/ASMBasics/blob/main/LIBA.ASM) that contains functions for getting decimal value from keyboard, for printing registers in different notations (BIN, HEX, DEC) and drawing rectangle on the screen.

In [FIRST.AM](https://github.com/ThreadJava800/ASMBasics/blob/main/EXPLM/FIRST.ASM) you can see basic interruptions.

In [COLORTXT.ASM](https://github.com/ThreadJava800/ASMBasics/blob/main/COLORTXT/COLORTXT.ASM) you can find an example of printing a colored string.

In [CALC.ASM](https://github.com/ThreadJava800/ASMBasics/blob/main/FUNCTION/CALC.ASM) you can find a calculator that adds two decimal numbers (taken from keyboard) and translates this value to HEX, BIN and DEC and prints.

In [RAMKA.ASM](https://github.com/ThreadJava800/ASMBasics/blob/main/RAMKA/RAMKA.ASM) you can see a call of a function that prints rectangle on screen (declared in [LIBA.ASM](https://github.com/ThreadJava800/ASMBasics/blob/main/LIBA.ASM)).

Updates coming!
